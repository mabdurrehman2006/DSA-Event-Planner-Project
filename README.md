# DSA-Event-Planner-Project

## Dependencies
Built using Python 3. Only uses standard libraries built in with python. Uses the following:
* **sys**: handling command line file arguements to run the program
* **time**: to measure algorithm execution speed
* **dataclasses**: for managing activity data for the brute force algorithm
## How to run
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to the directory where the event_planner.py file is located
3. Run the following depending on your file structure. <br>`python event_planner.py filename.txt`<br>I had my Input files stored in the "Inputs" subfolder when testing. The "Inputs" folder was located in the "Code" folder. So I would run the following:<br>`python event_planner.py Inputs/input_small.txt`

## File Structure Overview
The project is organised as follows:
* **Code/**: Contains `event_planner.py` and this `README` and extensions in separate python files
* **Input_Files/**: Contains `input_small.txt`, `input_medium.txt`, and `input_large.txt`
* **Documents/**: Contains the formal `Report.pdf` and the `Group_Contribution_Statement.pdf`
* **Presentation/**: Contains the `Presentation_Slides.pdf`
